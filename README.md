# CAR-LISTING-ANALYSIS
A dashboard showing Cars,Years, makes and prices and thier distribution across different states in America. This dashboard was built from a dataset of various car makes and their prices and years. Below are my data cleaning checklist:


•	Understanding the Data
•	handling blank cells
•	Removing duplicates
•	Correcting and formatting data types
•	Checking for inconsistencies.
•	Tabulizing the dataset

After cleaning my dataset, i Loaded it into powerbi. created a new measure to help calculate the total number of cars using the unique VIN numbers in the dataset. Then i showed KPIs and visualization. with the use of different visualization tools,I created a dashboard to Address the following key questions:

•	What is the relationship between the vehicle's age (year), mileage, location (city and state), manufacturer (make), and model, and its current market price? Can we build a robust predictive model to estimate the price of a vehicle based on these features?

•	Which factors (year, mileage, location, make, model) have the most significant impact on the vehicle's price? Are there any interactions between these features that further influence the price?

•	How does the location (city and state) affect the vehicle's price? Are there specific regions where certain makes or models command higher prices?

•	How does mileage influence the price of a vehicle? Is there a threshold beyond which mileage significantly depreciates the vehicle's value?

•	Which manufacturers and models tend to retain their value better over time? Are there specific models that are more sensitive to mileage or age?
