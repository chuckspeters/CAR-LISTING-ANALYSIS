# CAR-LISTING-ANALYSIS
I created a dashboard from a dataset of various car makes,their prices, years and their distribution across different states in America . Below are my data cleaning checklist:


•	Understanding the Data
•	handling blank cells
•	Removing duplicates
•	Correcting and formatting data types
•	Checking for inconsistencies.
•	Tabulizing the dataset

After cleaning my dataset, i Loaded it into power BI. created a new measure to help calculate the total number of cars using the unique VIN numbers in the dataset. Then i showed KPIs and visualization. with the use of different visualization tools.

I created a dashboard to Address the following key questions:

•	What is the relationship between the vehicle's age (year), mileage, location (city and state), manufacturer (make), and model, and its current market price? Can we build a robust predictive model to estimate the price of a vehicle based on these features?

•	Which factors (year, mileage, location, make, model) have the most significant impact on the vehicle's price? Are there any interactions between these features that further influence the price?

•	How does the location (city and state) affect the vehicle's price? Are there specific regions where certain makes or models command higher prices?

•	How does mileage influence the price of a vehicle? Is there a threshold beyond which mileage significantly depreciates the vehicle's value?

•	Which manufacturers and models tend to retain their value better over time? Are there specific models that are more sensitive to mileage or age?

ANALYTICAL SUMMARY.
Using the dataseet, we analyzed the data and created visualization to address: Price and Market Trends of Cars, Year and Mileage and how the Affect Pricing And Geographic Trends- That is to determine how Location affect Pricing of Cars. Our summary are captured below:

KEY FINDINGS:

1. Market Size and Revenue Potential
•	The total number of listed cars stands at 852K, indicating a large dataset of available Vehicles.
•	The estimated revenue potential is approximately $18 billion, suggesting a highly valuable market opportunity.
•	The average price per car is $21.46K, with a median price of $19K, showing a pricing range that aligns with mid-tier and premium vehicle segments.

2. Brand Performance and Pricing Trends
•	Top-listed brands include Ford (110K cars), Chevrolet (102K), and Toyota (78K), highlighting their dominant presence in the market.
•	The most expensive car brands are McLaren ($222K), Rolls-Royce ($203K), and Ferrari ($202K), reinforcing their positioning in the luxury segment.
•	Price Trends: Over time, vehicle prices have generally increased, possibly due to inflation, demand shifts, or new model releases.
4. Mileage Trends and Depreciation Analysis
•	Vehicles from earlier years (1997–2005) have significantly higher mileage, with a clear declining trend in recent models.
•	There is an inverse relationship between price and mileage—higher mileage generally correlates with lower price, which aligns with market expectations.
5. Geographic Market Insights
•	States with the highest average prices: Wyoming ($25.5K), Montana ($24.7K), and South Dakota ($24.3K), suggesting higher demand or lower supply in these regions.
•	Highest car listings by state: Texas (94K), California (80K), and Florida (72K), indicating strong sales potential in these markets.
•	Most expensive cities for car listings include La Jolla, Newport Beach, and Rancho Mirage, which aligns with high-income demographics.
    
 Business Recommendations
•	Target High-Volume States: Focus marketing and sales efforts in Texas, California, and Florida, where listing volume is highest, to maximize revenue potential.
•	Luxury Market Expansion: Leverage pricing data to position luxury models (McLaren, Rolls-Royce, Ferrari) effectively in premium markets.
•	Mileage-Based Pricing Strategy: Since higher mileage correlates with lower prices, use this data to create competitive pricing models and trade-in incentives.
•	Regional Pricing Adjustments: Adjust pricing strategies based on state-level pricing variations, particularly in Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, to align with market demand.
•	Inventory Optimization: Optimize inventory distribution to ensure that high-demand regions have sufficient stock while managing aging inventory effectively.

Conclusion
The Car Listing Dashboard reveals valuable insights into vehicle pricing, market trends, and geographic performance. By strategically leveraging this data, businesses can enhance pricing strategies  and maximize profitability in key regions.
